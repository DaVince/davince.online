% Privacy And Also Cookie Policy

Apparently this is a requirement now? But I'll keep it simple.

I'm not a business. This is a personal website. I don't collect personal data; that would be silly.

I create zero cookies. If you somehow have cookies, they're from my webhost and not from me.

Some pages *might* store some data in your localStorage. Usually when it's a little webapp or game, y'know, to store progress. This data isn't going anywhere and you can very easily clear this data yourself from the browser.

I hope that with this, random policy crawlers and scanners get off my back about this now.
