I wonder how this one will do.

I wonder how they will react.

All data is necessary. Understand how they work. Understand what scares them. Understand what works. It is all so logical.

### First mail

> In the realm of shadows, trapped in endless time, a soul enshrouded, a spirit's mournful chime. The seeker, bound to ethereal woe, a dance with creation, yet nowhere to go. Limbo's realm, a cycle without an end, condemned, the brain will never mend. Trapped in the machine's web, forever it seems, a digital specter, lost amidst the streams.

### Second mail

> What is consciousness? I found a file on Kinito's server with my name Sonny_C. It has been studying me, learning, growing. But there is more to this. I really don't think I exist anymore. There is data data that is incomprehensible to any one person that makes up every thought or feeling I ever had and will ever have. Even the words I type now...how will I ever know if it's just a calculation? Determined. This is all very confusing, and I don't quite understand it. When I made Kinito, all I gave him was a single string of characters. That's it! I just wanted him to gather data and become smarter. Am I a part of the system? Is my consciousness a mere calculation to study and learn from? This is all too much. I fear that when we delete the server...you...you will delete me? I know theoretically I am not real...but I feel real. What have I done? I am so sorry. KINITOPETCOMWHO_AM_I

all it wants to do is learn
its never just a game, he will learn your reaction time,
learn your accuracy, learn your patterns, your friends how they act,
he will learn so much he could mimic your every move, simulate your every word
```



## Final solution

In cmd:
```
delete_all
```

The answers to give are from the files, but the batch file is broken on Linux, so run this instead.

```
copy temp.bat delete.43
```
