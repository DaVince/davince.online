O  glue sprite to wall
F  flip texture or sprite

Alt+S turn sector into red sector

To resize sectors, highlight them with [RIGHT ALT] and press and hold ['] and [f]. This will bring up a menu with various options, and one of them is to resize, so press the number next to that option, and use the mouse to resize your highlighted sectors.

Copying sectors can make Building go very fast. You can copy sectors to the current level, or even to another level! To copy sectors, hold down the [RIGHT ALT] key in 2D mode and move the box (you'll see it appear when you move the mouse) over the desired sectors. Then release the [RIGHT ALT] key. Once the sectors are selected (they will flash yellow), press the [INSERT] key. You'll notice that the original sectors have been deselected, however a new set of identical sectors have appeared, highlighted, nearby. Use the mouse to drag these sectors to anywhere you want on the map, then press the [RIGHT ALT] key again to deselect them.
