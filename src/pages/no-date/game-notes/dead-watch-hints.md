# Hints from the community

The 14 Coins are found just on the ground except for 1.
The wrench isn't used until after the VHS and it's pretty obvious when you need to use it.
To stop the lights from going out you need to get into the basement. (The door with the key pad) If you haven't got into the basement then you need to feed the cat a burger. (The burger is hidden but there's no puzzle or anything)
If you've gotten into the basement:

If you want more of a hint:

If you've gotten to the higher floors:


Getting the VHS is really obtuse:
First 
Next 
If you can't find the VHS after that 


# Coin locations

FINISH THE GAME BUT DROP DOWN THE HOLE IN THE DRAWBRIDGE AT THE VERY END INSTEAD.

1. Walk beyond the door that requires 3 seconds to open, go in the crawlspace and pick the left path. It's behind the barrels.
2. In the same crawlspace, drop down into the kitchen pantry. There's a coin on the stove.
3. Library: 1 coin in the lower area
4. Library: 1 coin in the upper area on the right-hand side
5. Chest in Lumi's room between 3 and 6 O'clock
6. In the women's bathroom
7. In Kawaiwai's room, by walking through the green slide
8. In the office (the one that requires the key Kawaiwai gives you)
9. In the basement, climb only the first flight of stairs, then shimmy along the side between the bottom and top stairs to a hidden area.
10. In the bottom of the basement, next to the door and wine caskets.
11. In the back of the attic, on the opposite side of the fuse and note, behind a fallen over table.
12. In the room with the gears and pipes, on the floor, next to the slab requiring extra qualifications.
13. In the same room, climb up the pipes, all away around, and there will be a coin at the end.
14. Go right up until the ending, but before going through the final door, fall down instead. In the new loop, make sure Lumi is safe first by solving the green symbols code. Then go to the basement and into the room between stairs that had a coin. It now has a VHS tape. Take it and enjoy it in Lumi's room. Go to the attic and get the fuse. Go to the room with the push plate and stand on it. Go get Lumi to stand on it. Get the wrench from the women's bathroom. Go into the small room next to Comi and find the empty chest. Behind the chest, use the wrench on the bolt and look at the hint. In the library, pull the indicated book (in the back left on the top floor). Talk to Comi. Wait until everything gets dark. Replace the fuse in the fuse box in the basement. Wait until 7 and get the vodka bottle from the purple chest in the attic. Go back to Comi and give it to her for the final coin.
