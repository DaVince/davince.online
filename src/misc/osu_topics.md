# Does the star rebalancing in osu!taiko feel weird to anyone else?

I was on vacation for two weeks, but after returning, I am finding difficult beatmaps are given lower star ratings, and some easy beatmaps are given higher rankings. Frankly, I'm a little puzzled by this rebalancing and I'm wondering if anyone else is as well.

For example, [Hyakka Ryouran's highest difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/73451#taiko/271616) is now being ranked at 2.77 stars. I've able to easily FC beatmaps under 3 stars for over a year now (to the point where I tend to skip beatmaps that are ranked below 3 stars). But this beatmap is still a little tricky even now and I would *really* not call it any lower than 3 stars. And while osu!taiko is not Taiko no Tatsujin, let me make clear that a map like this would likely be a 7 star map there.

(need more examples)

One thing I'm wondering: I've always played with a tatacon. I recognize that many people probably play with the keyboard and they will probably have an easier time with higher star maps. Is this rebalancing based on how it plays with a keyboard rather than a taiko controller? If so, calculating the difficulty based on the input type would be a good idea (I realize how remote the chances of this happening are).



# Code contribution ideas

* Web: make user profile "Ranks" sortable by how long ago a score was set.
* Web: Make "global ranking" and "country ranking" clickable items that bring you to the rank list
* Web: graph for country ranking
* Web: indication in recent plays when a new high score was set on a beatmap
