## Events

* You had a loooong Wheel of Horror stream and played many games!
* You had your birthday stream! And the community SMASHED through all of the goals on just the second day! (CLAIMED BY AZURANSKI)
* You had a themed RPG Maker stream with 3 rotating games every time someone donated! That was fun and chaotic!
* You had a three day Halloween stream, which was truly scarring for life...

## Notable moments

* The community got together to save up for a new streaming PC, hooray!
* You obtained a Void!

## Game-related

* You played Poop Killer! (But when's Poop Killer 2?)
* You played Deadly Premonition! (But when's Deadly Premonition 2?)
* After much hardship, you were finally able to play Silent Hill: Downpour.
  * And then you were never able to finish it thanks to d̶̲͌͘i̶̲̔s̸͔̒ć̵̨̞ ̵̳̪͛̓r̷̨̈́̌ḙ̶̼̾̾ạ̴͑ḑ̴͇̆͌ ̶̪̈́e̷̪̩͗́r̵̩̫̎̾r̷̢͉͆ő̵͓̭͘r̵̬̥̓͒!
* You got Soggy Bob to finally get some action for the first time in his life!
  * Then you managed to have him pass away the very next day!

## All-time counts

These are all-time counts I think, when was each command introduced?

* 29 chatters have read and processed our cursed tag list... How many of them are still around, I wonder?
* Peggy has blindly stumbled into a hole 53 times.
* A woman has gotten Peggy in trouble at least 40 times.
  * 1 of which being Alfhilde, naturally.
